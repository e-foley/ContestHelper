<div class='faq-you'>What the heck is this?</div>
<div class='answer-you'>You&rsquo;ve found the Screenshot of the Week leaderboards. Each leaderboard ranks everybody who has entered the contest based on different criteria, such as votes, victories, and participation.</div>
<p/>
<div class='faq-you'>What is a member&rsquo;s &ldquo;formidable&rdquo; rating?</div>
<div class='answer-you'>The formidable rating measures Screenshot of the Week dominance. It is based on the <a class='green' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system'>Elo rating system</a> and has these properties:
<ul>
<li>Higher ratings are better.</li>
<li>Newcomers start with a rating of 1,500.</li>
<li>Your rating increases when you receive more votes in a contest than the algorithm expects you to receive given your rating and your opponents&rsquo; ratings. Inversely, you lose points when the algorithm thinks you underperform.</li>
<li>Rating points always move from one member to another. This means that the average rating always sticks at 1,500.</li>
<li>A two-to-one vote ratio corresponds to a rating difference of 500. This means that if your rating is 2,000, the algorithm expects you to receive twice as many votes as an average contestant. If your rating is 1,000, it expects you to receive half as many votes as an average contestant. (Don&rsquo;t take it personally!)</li>
<li>Because the algorithm only looks at votes rather than wins, it&rsquo;s possible for your rating to drop despite winning a contest or rise despite finishing last.</li>
<li>Ratings change quickly.</li>
</ul></div>
<p/>
<div class='faq-you'>How does somebody get half of a vote, entry, win, etc.?</div>
<div class='answer-you'>It&rsquo;s possible for two or more members to enter a shot together. (See <a class='green' href='https://www.purezc.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=5454'>SotW #50</a> and <a class='green' href='https://www.purezc.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=57298'>SotW #391</a>.)  When this happens, we divide all the metrics evenly. For example, a shot submitted by two members that earns 11 votes counts as 5.5 votes for each contributor. Also, Screenshot of the Week used to have occasional ties. In this situation, the win is split among those who tied for the most votes in the contest.</div>
<p/>
<div class='faq-you'>Some members have a plus sign (+) next to their votes. Why?</div>
<div class='answer-you'>The polls in Screenshots of the Week 1&ndash;4 are lost. For these contests, entrants are formally given zero votes but get preference in the leaderboards over members who would otherwise have the same number of votes.</div>
<p/>
<div class='faq-you'>Should I take these leaderboards seriously?</div>
<div class='answer-you'>The whole idea behind this page is to offer a unique retrospective on the history of the contest for fun. There are errors on it. The metrics have flaws. The code has bugs. The answer is no: do not take these stats seriously.</div>
<p/>
<div class='faq-you'>How is this page generated?</div>
<div class='answer-you'>We maintain text files describing contest results and member name changes. A Java applet processes the data and spits out HTML pages for you all to enjoy.</div>
<p/>
<div class='faq-you'>Whom should I contact with comments, questions or error reports?</div>
<div class='answer-you'><a class='green' href='http://www.purezc.net/forums/index.php?app=members&module=messaging&section=send&do=form&fromMemberID=2237'>Send a private message to nicklegends.</a>  He thanks you in advance for the feedback!</div>
